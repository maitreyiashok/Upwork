Trying something new
---------------
If this works Im a freaking genius. Or as a developer friend told me -a certified nerd. For all those of you who don't know me I suck at technology. So making my own website is kind of a big deal to me. But I'm excited about trying something new and I just hope that the will sticks around long enough for something good  to turn out of this. Welcome to writers-block! A space dedicated to pouring my heart and picking up a few things along the way. At this point Im not too worried about the content or the true purpose of this website and the focus is too figure out how to mkae this site look pretty. (so shallow na..) But whatever. My blog. My rules. SO ya. Thats it. stick around if you want to see what happens next.
